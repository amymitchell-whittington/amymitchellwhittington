### My first Tidy Tuesday submission

These past few months I've been playing around a lot in RStudio.  

I really wanted to get stuck into data visualizations, so I figured the best way would be to challenge myself weekly with [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly data project in R from the R4DS community.  

So, here's my first of *hopefully* many submissions. Luckily, I started off with a fun one - data from every single Scooby Doo episode and movie since 1969.  
The dataset came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman/scoobydoo-complete), manually aggregated by [plummye](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman).  
For this one, I wanted to see whether the motives changed for the Scooby Doo monsters over the decades using treemaps.  

I also decided to try out gganimate for the first time with my treemaps - it's a little hectic :smile:.
