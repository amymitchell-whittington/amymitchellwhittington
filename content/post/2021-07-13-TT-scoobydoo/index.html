<h3>My first Tidy Tuesday submission</h3>
<p>These past few months I’ve been playing around a lot in RStudio.</p>
<p>I really wanted to get stuck into data visualizations, so I figured the best way would be to challenge myself weekly with <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#TidyTuesday</a>, a weekly data project in R from the R4DS community.</p>
<p>So, here’s my first of <em>hopefully</em> many submissions. Luckily, I started off with a fun one - data from every single Scooby Doo episode and movie since 1969.<br />
The dataset came from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman/scoobydoo-complete">Kaggle</a>, manually aggregated by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman">plummye</a>.<br />
For this one, I wanted to see whether the motives changed for the Scooby Doo monsters over the decades using treemaps.</p>
<p>I also decided to try out gganimate for the first time with my treemaps - it’s a little hectic :smile:.</p>
