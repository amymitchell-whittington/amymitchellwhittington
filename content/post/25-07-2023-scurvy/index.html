<h2>Scurvy<a href="https://github.com/amymitchell-whittington/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2023/19-07-2023-gptdetectors/19-07-2023-gptdetectors.Rmd">&lt;/&gt;</a></h2>
<p>The data this week comes from the <a href="https://higgi13425.github.io/medicaldata/">medicaldata R package</a>. This is a data package from Peter Higgins, with 19 medical data sets for teaching Reproducible Medical Research with R.</p>
<p>The specific data set I visualised this week is from a study published in 1757 in <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/blob/master/man/description_docs/scurvy_desc.html">A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts, by James Lind.</a> I would suggest taking a read of Peter Higgins’ post on the study, it’s quite interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This data set contains 12 participants with scurvy. In 1757, it was not known that scurvy is a manifestation of vitamin C deficiency.
A variety of remedies had been anecdotally reported, but Lind was the first to test different regimens of acidic substances (including citrus fruits) against each other in a randomized, controlled trial.
6 distinct therapies were tested in 12 seamen with symptomatic scurvy, who were selected for similar severity.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Of note, there is some dispute about whether this was truly the first clinical trial, or whether it actually happened, as there are no contemporaneous corroborating accounts.</em></p>
<p>I really enjoyed reading a little into this study and the data, especially the dosage for each of the treatments. I didn’t include them in the end graph, so as not to crowd out the information too much, but I’ll add them here, just for interest.</p>
<p>Also, worth noting: Based on this study, only one of the 12 seamen showed no symptoms after treatment - he was treated with two lemons and an orange, daily.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@nrennie">Nicola Rennie’s</a> wonderful visualisation for this data set and wanted to set out to recreate something similar!</p>
<p>In terms of cleaning the data this week (it came with a lot of “_” and numbers), I familiarised myself with the <code>stringr</code> package, especially the <code>str_replace_all()</code> function, which was fun. Although, I struggled to apply this function for more than one variable to replace, so had to input manually.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it would be fun to use the <code>geom_lime()</code> function (each point is the shape of a lime on a graph), but realised I couldn’t map the symptom severity to the size of each lime so I scrapped that idea. I am on the lookout for a data set to use it on in the future!</p>
<p>I wanted to try out different shapes as a way to visualise the severity of symptoms after the treatments, but given there was more than one sailor for each treatment, it meant there was an overlap of shapes, which I thought looked confusing. For example, one sailor being treated with vinegar might still have severe gum rot while another also being treated with vinegar might only have mild gum rot.</p>
<p>While I ended up representing the severity of symptom by size, I wasn’t 100% happy with the outcome so I rearranged the y-axis so as to have cider and citrus (the two best performers) at the top.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would have been better to signify the symptoms of each of the 12 patients. Might be something to consider with a different visualisation.</p>
