<p>Data this week comes from the <a href="https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=StagedProducts/GeographicNames/">National Map Staged Products Directory</a> from the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/us-board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data">US Board of Geographic Names.</a>.</p>
<p>This was a fun #TidyTuesday data set to work with because it timed well with some friends who flew to the U.S. last week to have an Elvis wedding in Las Vegas ðŸ’ž</p>
<p>Theyâ€™re renting an RV and hitting the road, with plans to stop at a few major national parks in the area, so I thought I would use their honeymoon travel itinerary as a guide to visualising this weekâ€™s U.S. Populated Places data.</p>
<p>Using the usmap package was a little tricky, as I had to transform my data so I could plot it properly. I think after my attempt at using a different maps package to plot reported UFO sightings in Australia last week, I might need to try out ggmaps to see if itâ€™s a little more streamlined.</p>
<p>I had such a hard time trying to work out why there was so much blank space around my map, see here:</p>

But, after A LOT OF GOOGLING, I found this:</p>
<p><em>The Cartesian coordinate system is the most familiar, and common, type of coordinate system. Setting limits on the coordinate system will zoom the plot (like youâ€™re looking at it with a magnifying glass), and will not change the underlying data like setting limits on a scale will.</em> <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html">Via this ggplot2 ref. site</a></p>
<p>So I added coord_cartesian() to my ggplot and voila! I now need to do some digging into how EXACTLY this works ðŸ˜…</p>
