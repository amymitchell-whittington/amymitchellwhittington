<h2>U.S.Populated Places <a href="https://github.com/amymitchell-whittington/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2023/27-06-2023-USpopulatedplaces/27-06-2023USpopulatedplaces.Rmd">&lt;/&gt;</a></h2>
<p>Data this week comes from the <a href="https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=StagedProducts/GeographicNames/">National Map Staged Products Directory</a> from the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/us-board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data">US Board of Geographic Names.</a>.</p>
<p>This was a fun #TidyTuesday data set to work with because it timed well with some friends who flew to the U.S. last week to have an Elvis wedding in Las Vegas!</p>
<p>They’re hiring an RV and hitting the road for a few weeks, with plans to stop at a few major national parks in the area, so I thought I would use their honeymoon travel itinerary as a guide to visualising some of this week’s data.</p>
<p>Using the usmap package was a little tricky, as I had to transform my data so I could plot it properly. I think after my attempt at using a different maps package to plot reported UFO sightings onto a map of Australia last week, I might need to try out ggmaps to see if it’s a little more streamlined.</p>
<p>I ran out of time to try and tweak the plot .png, as it is a lot narrower than my previous knitted plots. I’ll have to do some research into why that is and try to remedy it for next week’s data.</p>
