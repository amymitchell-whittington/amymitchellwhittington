## Hot Ones[</>](https://github.com/amymitchell-whittington/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2023/08-08-2023-hotones/08-08-2023-hotones.R)  

The data this week comes from Wikipedia articles: [Hot Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Ones) and [List of Hot Ones episodes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hot_Ones_episodes)

> *Hot Ones is an American YouTube talk show, created by Chris Schonberger, hosted by Sean Evans and produced 
> by First We Feast and Complex Media. Its basic premise involves celebrities being interviewed by Evans over a 
> *platter of increasingly spicy chicken wings.

I probably watched way too many episodes of Hot Ones while creating this visualisation, which I'm not mad about. It's a pretty funny show - I really just skipped to the end of each episode to see how everyone handled #10, the hottest wing.

For my visualisation, I wanted to get an idea of whether the spice levels increased by season. Each season uses the same 10 sauces across each of it's episodes so I didn't need to worry about variation between episodes, just seasons. I used the sauces data to sum every 10 scoville ratings (equivalent to the 10 sauces used per season), averaged it out and then mapped to a data frame, which I used to plot my visualisation.

A point to remember: If I want to count every n consecutive numbers (as I did for this), I need to use ```colSums```. If I want to sum every nth number, I need to use ```rowSums```, but this will only work if n divides ```length(v)```.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggtext)
library(scales) # added this package to add commas to my y-axis for clarity.

```

```{r explore, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}

###note: If you want to sum every n consecutive numbers use colSums
#If you want to sum every nth number use rowSums
n <- 10
v <- sauces$scoville

#total scoville per season function:
colSums(matrix(v, nrow=n))

#average scoville rating
av_scoville <- colSums(matrix(v, nrow=n))/10

#to make a data.frame
season <- c(1:21)
av_scoville <- colSums(matrix(v, nrow=n))/10
df <- data.frame(season, av_scoville)

#to round percentage up to nearest integer
df$av_scoville <- ceiling(df$av_scoville)

##the percentage change between each average scoville ranking per season

perc_change <- df %>%
  mutate(lag = lag(av_scoville),
         perc_change = (av_scoville - lag) / lag * 100) %>%
  mutate(perc_change = ifelse(is.na(perc_change), 0, perc_change))


```

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE, include = TRUE, message=FALSE, dpi = 300}

a <- ifelse(df$av_scoville == 332770, "yellow", "red4") #to highlight season 5 on the graph - used in theme() below:

```

I originally wanted to see what the % change of the average scoville score was season on season, but when I mapped it out, it looked a little too complicated. I'm including it here for reference:

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE, include = TRUE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

##% change of average scoville score season on season
perc_change %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = perc_change)) +
  geom_line(colour = "red") +
  geom_point(colour = "red") +
  geom_label(
    label="The average hot sauce scoville score per season fluctuated\ndramatically in the early seasons of the show,\nand evened out after season 7.", 
    x=6,
    y=40,
    label.padding = unit(0.55, "lines"), # Rectangle size around label
    label.size = 0.35,
    color = "yellow",
    fill="red4",
    hjust = 0) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-20, 140), breaks = c(-20, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140), labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:21)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = "red2", face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, colour = "red2"),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, colour = "red2", face = "italic"),
