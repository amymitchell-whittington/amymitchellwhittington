<h2>U.S.Historical Markers <a href="https://github.com/amymitchell-whittington/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2023/04-07-2023-historicmarkers/04-07-2023-historicalmarkers.Rmd">&lt;/&gt;</a></h2>
<p>The data this week comes from the <a href="https://www.hmdb.org/geolists.asp?c=United%20States%20of%20America">Historical Marker Database USA Index.</a></p>
<p>This searchable online catalogue was so fun to explore! I didn’t realise there was such a thing online (probably because there are only 36 Australian markers recorded on the site compared to 183k U.S. markers).</p>
<p>According to the database, it is <em>“an illustrated searchable online catalog of historical information viewed through the filter of roadside and other permanent outdoor markers, monuments, and plaques”.</em> Anyone can contribute, either by adding new markers or updating existing marker pages.</p>
<p>For this Tidy Tuesday project, only the U.S. marker database was provided and what caught my eye the most was the column relating to missing markers.</p>
<p>I wanted to use percentages because I felt it was the best way to represent the data, and was surprised by the amount of markers that were reported or confirmed missing. I wonder what happened to them?</p>
<p>This was also a great way to test out the labs() annotate function and play around with positioning.</p>
