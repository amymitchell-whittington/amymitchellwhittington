<h3>U.S. drought: The number of people living in the western states of the U.S. impacted by drought <a href="https://github.com/amymitchell-whittington/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2021/20-07-2021-usdrought/20-07-2021-usdrought.Rmd">&lt;/&gt;</a></h3>
<p>This weekâ€™s TidyTuesday data comes from the <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/ComprehensiveStatistics.aspx">U.S. Drought Monitor</a>.</p>
<p>The dataset details the drought level across U.S. states from 2001-2021. I wanted to look at the number of people who have experienced severe, extreme, and/or exceptional drought conditions over this time in the western states of the U.S.</p>
<p>This one was a bit tricky. I wanted to show the impact of people affected by severe+ drought and decided to use the western states as an example because on first glance, that area seemed to be hit quite hard with drought over the years.</p>
<p>Using the pop_pct would have been a lot easier to read at graph level, but I struggled to work out how I could add % of pop. for each drought level by each week to create the graph I wanted.</p>
<p>The outcome was a stacked graph that ended up looking quite messy. This was a good learning curve.</p>
